## 💰 ROI Calculation

### **Time Savings (Real Numbers):**

```
Traditional Testing:
- Write test: 30 minutes
- Execute: 5 minutes
- Debug failures: 45 minutes
- Total per test: 80 minutes

With AIQA:
- Write test (NL): 2 minutes
- Execute: 1.5 seconds
- Auto-fix failures: 22 seconds
- Total per test: 3 minutes

Savings per test: 77 minutes (96% faster!)
```

### **Cost Savings (10,000 tests/year):**

```
QA Engineer Cost: $50/hour

Traditional:
- 10,000 tests × 80 min = 800,000 minutes
- 800,000 / 60 = 13,333 hours
- 13,333 hours × $50 = $666,650/year

With AIQA:
- 10,000 tests × 3 min = 30,000 minutes
- 30,000 / 60 = 500 hours
- 500 hours × $50 = $25,000/year

Annual Savings: $641,650! 🎉
