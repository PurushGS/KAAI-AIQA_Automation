## 🌐 Access Point

**ONE URL FOR EVERYTHING:**
```
http://localhost:3007
```

That's it. That's the only URL you need to remember!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Start with Dashboard**
Always land on the dashboard to see:
- How many tests you've run
- Your success rate
- System health
- Quick action buttons

### **Tip 2: Use Natural Language Freely**
Don't worry about exact phrasing:
```
✅ "Test the login"
✅ "Go to example.com and check header"
✅ "Verify button is clickable"
✅ "Navigate to URL and find element"
```

### **Tip 3: Enable Headless for Speed**
```
Headless ON:  Tests run in ~2 seconds
Headless OFF: Tests run in ~4 seconds
```
Only disable headless when debugging!

### **Tip 4: Use Knowledge Base Intelligently**
```
Instead of: "test_12345"
Ask: "Show me tests that failed with 404 errors"

Instead of: "SELECT * FROM tests"
Ask: "What are common failure patterns?"
```

### **Tip 5: Monitor Services Regularly**
```
Go to Services tab daily to:
- Ensure all services are running
- Check for degraded performance
- Verify connectivity
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Page Won't Load**
```
Check:
1. Is Phase 6 running? (ps aux | grep node)
2. Is port 3007 free? (lsof -ti:3007)
3. Run: ./START_UNIFIED_PLATFORM.sh

Solution: Restart Phase 6
```

### **Issue: Test Execution Fails**
```
Check:
1. Services tab - Is Phase 2 healthy?
2. Are test steps valid JSON?
3. Is the target URL accessible?

Solution: Check Services tab for diagnostics
```

### **Issue: Knowledge Base Empty**
```
Check:
1. Is Phase 4.5 running?
2. Have you executed any tests?
3. Is ChromaDB running? (lsof -ti:8000)

Solution: Execute a test first, it auto-stores
```

### **Issue: UI Looks Broken**
```
Check:
1. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console (F12)

Solution: Usually a cache issue
```
